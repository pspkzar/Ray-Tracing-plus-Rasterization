Atomics, samplers, images are opaque types, i.e. they are handlers for more complex objects. 
	can't be assigned
	can't be read directly
	
when aggregated in an array, atomic counters can only be indexed with a dynamically uniform integer expression (3.8.3)
	
4.4.6.1
layouts and offsets
layout(binding=1, offset=4) uniform atomic_uint bla;
bindings are always required, offsets get post incremented, and can be ommited by default.
	
8.10
atomic counter functions
increment
decrement

Buffer creation
	glGenBuffers(1,&m_AtomicCountersBuffer);
	glBindBuffer(GL_ATOMIC_COUNTER_BUFFER, m_AtomicCountersBuffer);
	glBufferData(GL_ATOMIC_COUNTER_BUFFER, sizeof(GLuint) * MAX_COUNTERS, NULL, GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW);
	glBindBuffer(GL_ATOMIC_COUNTER_BUFFER, 0);
	
setting a binding point	
	glBindBufferBase(GL_ATOMIC_COUNTER_BUFFER, 1, m_AtomicCountersBuffer);
